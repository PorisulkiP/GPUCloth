<h2 align="center">Cloth simulation for Blender 2.93.x with CUDA</h2>

<h3 align="center">(in development)</h2>

## Why GPUCloth?

- Faster when standart cloth simulation
- Use CUDA that's faster when OpenCL
- If you buy NVIDIA graphic card why will not buy this addon?
- If you have a graphics card from AMD, do not panic and do not leave, as soon as possible we will add support for OpenCL

## Development stage

![Status of project](https://sun9-65.userapi.com/impg/5uUstxgQ6bYp4wHgtEuXrtOytzslSWQvFL8svQ/NxnooRXEXCU.jpg?size=1280x588&quality=96&sign=ab03d7abd022b7a29773e9075c9daee0&type=album)

## Project setup

```
cd path/to/blender.exe
blender --python /path/to/script/main.py
```

## About the project.

The essence of the project:
>Speed up the process of physically based  calculation of the cloth simulation by transferring calculations from the CPU to the GPU

The project is being developed for passing a discipline in college, so it can be abandoned
